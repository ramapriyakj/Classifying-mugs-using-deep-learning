# Classifying mugs using deep learning and data augmentation

In the project, we will use data augmeantation to classify the mugs we drink from.


As we can see, all data can be found in the data folder. The data has already been split in training data and test data. They are respectively in the train folder and test folder. In those folders, we can find four folders which represent the mugs we need to classify. There are four kind of mugs: the white mug, the black mug (the ML6 mug), the blue mug and the transparent mug (the glass). The white mug is class 0, the black mug class 1, the blue mug class 2 and the transparent mug class 3. These class numbers are necessary to create a correct classifier.


As you can notice, there is very less data to come up with an accurate deep learning model.

In this project we will use data augmenation to improve classification accuracy.
